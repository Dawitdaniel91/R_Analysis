# Overview of Project

This special project is to find solution for the AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In the project, I will help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

  . Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
  
  . Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  
  . Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  
  . Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis,I will write a summary interpretation of the findings.
  
  The project consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. 

    1. Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
    
    2. Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
    
    3. Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
    
    4. Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
    
  # Resources Used
  
  . Data Source: MechaCar_mpg.csv and Suspension_Coil.csv
  
  . Data Tools: tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, geom_boxplot and MechaCarChallenge.RScript.
  
  . Software: RStudio and R
  
 ## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
 
    ### Deliverable Requirements:
    
    .  The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe
    
    .  An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables
    
    .  An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values
    
    .  There is a summary that addresses all three questions
